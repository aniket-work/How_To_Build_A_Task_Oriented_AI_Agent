# Tutorial: Setting Up and Running AI Agent Powered Refund Processing System

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of virtual environments and command-line tools.

## Steps

1. **Virtual Environment Setup:**
   - Create a dedicated virtual environment for our project:
   
     ```bash
     python -m venv How_To_Build_A_Task_Oriented_AI_Agent
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
   
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       How_To_Build_A_Task_Oriented_AI_Agent\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - Unix/macOS:
       ```bash
       source How_To_Build_A_Task_Oriented_AI_Agent/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   - Navigate to your project directory and install required packages using `pip`:
   
    ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
       
   if you wish to use original AgentLite repo, follow below
    git clone https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/AgentLite.git
    cd AgentLite
    pip install -e .     
    
    
    ```

3. **Run - Task Oriented AI Agents**

   Finally, execute the following command to start the "Task Oriented AI Agents" application:

   ```bash 
   # Run Task Oriented AI Agents
   (How_To_Build_A_Task_Oriented_AI_Agent) C:\Users\worka\PycharmProjects\How_To_Build_A_Task_Oriented_AI_Agent>python AgentLite\example\SearchManager.py
    ```
